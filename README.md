#### Description

Understanding how data changes over time is essential for specifying
suitable forecasting models. Comprehensively exploring modern
time-series datasets is challenging, where a large number of frequently
observed time series contains many patterns. This workshop introduces
new exploratory techniques to uncover meaningful temporal patterns in
time series data.

We’ll explore how to compare patterns across many series using
feature-based summaries. Visualizing these features reveals common
temporal patterns, cluster related time series, and see how these
patterns vary throughout the hierarchical structure of the data.

We’ll then use a grammar of time series graphics to produce plots that
clearly show the shape and variability in these patterns. Special
attention will be given to the complexities of sub-daily data (such as
timezones), allowing us to create stunning calendar plots which uncovers
holiday effects and complex seasonalities.

This practical workshop features live demonstrations and hands-on
exercises using real-world data, equipping participants with the skills
to effectively manipulate and visualize time series data in R.

## Learning Outcomes

1.  How to use the tidyverse to wrangle and manipulate time series data
2.  Visualise data and identify common time series patterns
3.  Use time series features to find patterns in many time series
4.  Apply the grammar of time series graphics to visualize complex
    seasonalities

#### Structure

<!-- 
Hour 1: Time series data, aggregations, and visualization basics 
Hour 2: Time series decomposition and features 
Hour 3: The grammar of time series graphics 
-->

**Session 1** (13:00 - 14:20)

The first session explores common time series patterns. Starting with
identifying trend and seasonality in a single time series, we will work
toward summarising patterns across a large collections of time series.

- Time series data
- Temporal granularity, statistics, and aggregation
- Time series patterns and time plots
- STL decomposition
- Feature analysis

**Session 2** (14:30 - 15:50)

The second session focuses on calendrical patterns such as seasonality
and holidays. We will start with visualising seasonal patterns in highly
aggregated quarterly data and work toward visualising complex seasonal
patterns in sub-daily data.

- Seasonal plots (aes/data -\> scale -\> coord)
- Seasonal sub-series plots
- Exploring seasonality after STL decomposition
- Multiple seasonality in daily and sub-daily data
- Local/civil and global/absolute time
- Calendar plots

**User-study** (15:50 - 16:00)

### Format

3 hour workshop.
